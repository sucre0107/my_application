		<!-- Overview -->
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			1. Overview
		</h3>
		<div class="mb-2">
			<p>
				The EasyNode ARS2048B is a four-channel lighting signal converter. The name "ARS2048B" comprises key
				aspects of its functionality:
			</p>
			<div class="my-3 ">
				<p><span class="font-bold">"A"</span> stands for Artnet, indicating the device's compatibility with the
					Artnet protocol.</p>
				<p><span class="font-bold">"R"</span> represents RDM, denoting that the device supports the RDM
					protocol.</p>
				<p><span class="font-bold">"S"</span> signifies sACN, which means that the device can convert sACN into
					DMX.</p>
				<p><span class="font-bold">"2048"</span> suggests that the device can output to four DMX domains
					simultaneously.</p>
				<p><span class="font-bold">"B"</span> is for bidirectional, representing the device's ability to convert
					Artnet and sACN protocols into
					DMX.</p>
			</div>
			In essence, the ARS2048B serves as a versatile tool for individuals seeking a lighting signal converter that
			seamlessly converts both Artnet and sACN protocols into DMX, while offering the convenience of multi-domain
			output.
		</div>
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			2. Hardware
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			The EasyNode ARS2048B is a compact and portable device, designed with user-friendliness and versatility in
			mind. It boasts 4 DMX interfaces, accommodating both 3-pin and 5-pin connectors, offering flexibility for
			various lighting setups. A Type-C interface is included, dedicated for providing power supply, while an
			Ethernet port enables network communication via protocols such as Artnet, sACN and RDM. The front panel of
			the
			device is intuitively designed, featuring a mode function button and an LED indicator light, which allow
			users to easily adjust the working mode and restore factory settings.

			3. LAN Configuration
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			To use the controller or control software, it is necessary to ensure that your computer and the controller
			are on the same local area network (LAN).

			If the controller's IP address has not been changed, the default IP address is 2.0.0.10, with a subnet mask
			of 255.0.0.0. To set the computer's IP address within the LAN, you should navigate to your computer's
			network settings and manually input an IP address that is within the same subnet as the controller.

			When using a router, you should adjust the settings of the controller and the computer to match the router's
			IP address scheme. This usually involves changing the first three segments of the IP address to match the
			router's IP address while keeping the fourth segment unique to avoid IP address conflict.
		</p>

		<!-- Web Configuration -->
		<h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">
			4. Web Configuration
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			The EasyNode ARS2048B provides flexible network configuration options through an application for Windows and
			via a web browser interface. Beyond the node's network configuration, the application also offers additional
			functions such as RDM and DMX console.
			<br>
			To configure the network settings, you can visit the configuration website corresponding to each device's IP
			address. From here, you have the option to enable or disable DHCP (which is disabled by default) or manually
			set the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address. Unless otherwise specified, each device is pre-set
			with an IP address of 2.0.0.10 and a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 upon shipment.
			<br>
			You also have the option to select the DMX refresh rate from three choices: 25Hz, 30Hz, and 35Hz, with 30Hz
			being the default setting. Additionally, you have the freedom to set the universe to the XLR
			ports on the rear panel.

			5.2 Network Configuration
		</h4>
		<h5>5.2.1 Select Correct Network Card for Communication </h5>
		<p class="mb-2">
			Upon launching the application, the first step is to select the correct network card. For demonstration
			purposes, we are using a laptop with two network card options available:
			<br>
			Host Address: 2.0.0.11 with NetMask: 255.0.0.0, which corresponds to the laptop's wired network card. <br>
			Host Address: 192.168.1.18 with NetMask: 255.255.255.0, which corresponds to the laptop's wireless network
			card. <br>
			In this scenario, we should obviously choose the wired network card, as our device connects via a wired
			connection. Additionally, the IP address 2.0.0.11 of the wired network card and the default IP address
			2.0.0.10 of the device are in the same network segment.

		<h5 class="mb-2 mt-5">5.2.2 Demonstration of Network Configuration on the App</h5>
		<p class="mb-2">
			First, ensure that the correct network card has been selected. Then, click the "Find Node" button. The list
			box will display the information of the nodes that can be found. Select the device you want to modify and
			switch the right tab to "Art-Net". Click the "Read" button to retrieve the device's information. Just like
			the Web Configuration interface mentioned above, you can modify all network configurations.

			5.2.3 Demonstration of RDM Configuration on the App
		</h5>
		<p class="mb-2">
			First, ensure that our EasyNode ARS2048B has been identified, and the lighting fixtures that requires
			modification are connected to the "B" port on the back panel (you can use any of the A, B, C, D ports; in
			this demonstration, we're using the "B" port). Begin by switching to the "RDM" tab on the right, then set
			the interface to "B". Click the "RDM Discovery" button, and the app will search for and display the
			connected lighting fixtures in the window.
