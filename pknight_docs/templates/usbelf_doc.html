		<h2 class="mb-2">USBelf Tutorial</h2>
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			1. Overview
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			USBelf includes a small hardware dongle and a suite of
			mobile and desktop applications. Together, they provide
			wireless DMX and RDM control as well as several other
			useful functions to the user's smartphone and Windows PC.
			In addition to its RDM capabilities, the product also serves
			as a mini DMX console. It allows recording of console
			output DMX signals and storing them in project files, which
			can be output to the lighting fixtures at any time.
			USBelf stands out for its simplicity, powerful features, and
			high reliability. We believe it will be your ideal choice.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			2. Hardware
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			The USBelf is a compact and portable device that comes
			equipped with a 3-pin or 5-pin DMX interface, as well as a
			Type-C wired interface for power supply and communication
			with desktop applications. It also features an antenna that
			allows users to connect their mobile devices to the hotspot
			generated by the USBelf, enabling wireless control of
			connected lighting fixtures.
			The product includes a mode indicator light, WiFi channel
			indicator light, WiFi channel switching button on the back
			panel. The wireless mode indicator light can be used in
			conjunction with the wireless mode WiFi channel switch
			button. Each time the button is pressed, it switches to a
			different WiFi channel, and the indicator light changes
			color accordingly. This feature is particularly useful in
			environments with many WiFi signals, allowing users to
			select a relatively clean communication environment by
			switching WiFi channels.

			To connect our hardware device to the computer app, simply use the USBA to Type-C cable included in the

			address matches that of your computer and the message 'connected successfully' is displayed, the connection
			has been established.

					Here, actual No. is an abbreviation for actual number.
					when we need to write DMX address codes for multiple RDM light fixtures that have been discovered,
					we
					naturally want to be able to do it all at once. Therefore, we need to set the actual number of each
					fixture before using the "One-click batch addressing" or "Visual addressing" tools to perform batch
					addressing.

							In the image above, we can see two lighting fixtures that were found and displayed within
							the red border. Each fixture is labeled with a number at the beginning of its row: "1-1" and
							"2-2". The number before the "-" represents the order in which the fixtures were discovered,
							while the number after the "-" indicates their actual position within the lighting system.
							To facilitate batch DMX address coding later on, we can edit the fixture's actual position
							by entering a new number in the "Actual No." box.<br>
							For instance, if we want to modify the actual position of the first discovered fixture to 2
							and the second discovered fixture to 1, we can select the first fixture and enter "2" in the
							"Actual No." editing box located above. Then, we can select the second fixture and enter "1"
							in the same editing box. Please refer to the image below:
