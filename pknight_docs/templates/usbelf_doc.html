		<h2 class="mb-2">USBelf Tutorial</h2>
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			1. Overview
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			USBelf includes a small hardware dongle and a suite of
			mobile and desktop applications. Together, they provide
			wireless DMX and RDM control as well as several other
			useful functions to the user's smartphone and Windows PC.
			In addition to its RDM capabilities, the product also serves
			as a mini DMX console. It allows recording of console
			output DMX signals and storing them in project files, which
			can be output to the lighting fixtures at any time.
			USBelf stands out for its simplicity, powerful features, and
			high reliability. We believe it will be your ideal choice.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			2. Hardware
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			The USBelf is a compact and portable device that comes
			equipped with a 3-pin or 5-pin DMX interface, as well as a
			Type-C wired interface for power supply and communication
			with desktop applications. It also features an antenna that
			allows users to connect their mobile devices to the hotspot
			generated by the USBelf, enabling wireless control of
			connected lighting fixtures.
			The product includes a mode indicator light, WiFi channel
			indicator light, WiFi channel switching button on the back
			panel. The wireless mode indicator light can be used in
			conjunction with the wireless mode WiFi channel switch
			button. Each time the button is pressed, it switches to a
			different WiFi channel, and the indicator light changes
			color accordingly. This feature is particularly useful in
			environments with many WiFi signals, allowing users to
			select a relatively clean communication environment by
			switching WiFi channels.

								editing box located above.
							</p>
							<!-- tab - UUID  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ UUID </span> <br>
								"UUID" is the abbreviation of "Universally Unique Identifier". Each lamp has its own
								unique
								hexadecimal code.
							</p>
							<!-- tab - Addr  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Addr </span> <br>
								"Addr" is the abbreviation of "Address", representing the DMX address code of the

							<!-- tab - Chan  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">

							<!-- tab - Device Lable  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Device Lable </span> <br>
								As the name suggests, "label" refers to the label or identifier of the luminaire. It is
								usually a phrase, word, or number used to identify and distinguish different fixtures.
							</p>
							<!-- tab - Manufacturer Lable  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Manufacturer Lable </span> <br>
								As the name suggests, "Manufacturer label" refers to the label or identifier of the

							</p>
							<!-- tab -  Device Mode  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Device Mode </span> <br>
								"Device Mode" is a description of the functions of the fixture. For example, if the
								fixture
								is a beam light, it is in "beam mode"; if it is a color-changing light, it is in "wash
								mode"; if it is a pattern light, it is in "spot mode", and so on.
							</p>
							<!-- tab -  Personality Description  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Personality Description </span> <br>
								The options for describing "Personality" in DMX lighting include various preset modes
								that
								describe the functions and control methods of a fixture. Each Personality contains a set
								of
								channels that can control different attributes of the fixture, such as color,
								brightness,
								movement, etc. Examples of Personality options include "RGB", "CMY", "Color Wheel", and
								others, each corresponding to a different color control method. Users can select the
								appropriate Personality and set the value of each channel to control the effect of the
								fixture using a DMX controller.
							</p>
							<!-- tab -  Software Version  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Software Version </span> <br>
								"Software Version" refers to the specific version of software that is installed on the
								fixture
							</p>
							<!-- tab -  Sensor Count  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Sensor Count </span> <br>
								"Sensor Count" refers to the number of sensors installed on the fixture. <br>
								Sensors can help users better understand the working status and environmental conditions
								of
								the fixture, thereby improving the management and maintenance of the fixture. For
								example,
								when the sensor detects that the temperature of the fixture is too high, the controller
								can
								automatically reduce the brightness of the fixture or turn off the fixture to avoid
								overheating and damage. In addition, sensors can also be used to monitor the power
								status
								and service life of the fixture, reminding users to replace bulbs or repair fixtures in
								a
								timely manner.

								In summary, sensors are an important component of RDM fixtures that provide useful
								environmental and status information to help users better manage and maintain the
								fixture.
