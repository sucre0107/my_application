			Overview
		</h4>
		<p class="ml-2 mb-2">
			USBelf includes a small hardware dongle and a suite of
			mobile and desktop applications. Together, they provide
			wireless DMX and RDM control as well as several other
			useful functions to the user's smartphone and Windows PC.
			In addition to its RDM capabilities, the product also serves
			as a mini DMX console. It allows recording of console
			output DMX signals and storing them in project files, which
			can be output to the lighting fixtures at any time.
			USBelf stands out for its simplicity, powerful features, and
			high reliability. We believe it will be your ideal choice.

			Hardware
		</h4>
		<p class="ml-2 mb-2">
			The USBelf is a compact and portable device that comes
			equipped with a 3-pin or 5-pin DMX interface, as well as a
			Type-C wired interface for power supply and communication
			with desktop applications. It also features an antenna that
			allows users to connect their mobile devices to the hotspot
			generated by the USBelf, enabling wireless control of
			connected lighting fixtures.
			The product includes a mode indicator light, WiFi channel
			indicator light, WiFi channel switching button on the back
			panel. The wireless mode indicator light can be used in
			conjunction with the wireless mode WiFi channel switch
			button. Each time the button is pressed, it switches to a
			different WiFi channel, and the indicator light changes
			color accordingly. This feature is particularly useful in
			environments with many WiFi signals, allowing users to
			select a relatively clean communication environment by
			switching WiFi channels.
