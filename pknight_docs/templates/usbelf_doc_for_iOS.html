		<h2 class="mb-2">USBelf on iOS Tutorial</h2>
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			1. Overview
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			USBelf includes a small hardware dongle and a suite of
			mobile and desktop applications. Together, they provide
			wireless DMX and RDM control as well as several other
			useful functions to the user's smartphone and Windows PC.
			In addition to its RDM capabilities, the product also serves
			as a mini DMX console. It allows recording of console
			output DMX signals and storing them in project files, which
			can be output to the lighting fixtures at any time.
			USBelf stands out for its simplicity, powerful features, and
			high reliability. We believe it will be your ideal choice.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mb-2">
			2. Hardware
		</h3>
		<p class="mb-2">
			The USBelf is a compact and portable device that comes
			equipped with a 3-pin or 5-pin DMX interface, as well as a
			Type-C wired interface for power supply and communication
			with desktop applications. It also features an antenna that
			allows users to connect their mobile devices to the hotspot
			generated by the USBelf, enabling wireless control of
			connected lighting fixtures.
			The product includes a mode indicator light, WiFi channel
			indicator light, WiFi channel switching button on the back
			panel. The wireless mode indicator light can be used in
			conjunction with the wireless mode WiFi channel switch
			button. Each time the button is pressed, it switches to a
			different WiFi channel, and the indicator light changes
			color accordingly. This feature is particularly useful in
			environments with many WiFi signals, allowing users to
			select a relatively clean communication environment by
			switching WiFi channels.

							<!-- tab - Device Lable  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Device Lable </span> <br>
								As the name suggests, "label" refers to the label or identifier of the luminaire. It is

							<!-- tab - Manufacturer Lable  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">

							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Device Mode </span> <br>
								"Device Mode" is a description of the functions of the fixture. For example, if the

								mode"; if it is a pattern light, it is in "spot mode", and so on.
							</p>
							<!-- tab -  Personality Description  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Personality Description </span> <br>
								The options for describing "Personality" in DMX lighting include various preset modes
								that
								describe the functions and control methods of a fixture. Each Personality contains a set
								of
								channels that can control different attributes of the fixture, such as color,
								brightness,
								movement, etc. Examples of Personality options include "RGB", "CMY", "Color Wheel", and
								others, each corresponding to a different color control method. Users can select the
								appropriate Personality and set the value of each channel to control the effect of the
								fixture using a DMX controller.
							</p>
							<!-- tab -  Software Version  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Software Version </span> <br>
								"Software Version" refers to the specific version of software that is installed on the

							</p>
							<!-- tab -  Sensor Count  -->
							<p class="mt-3 mb-2 text-gray-500">
								<span class="font-bold">★ Sensor Count </span> <br>
								"Sensor Count" refers to the number of sensors installed on the fixture. <br>
								Sensors can help users better understand the working status and environmental conditions
								of
								the fixture, thereby improving the management and maintenance of the fixture. For
								example,
								when the sensor detects that the temperature of the fixture is too high, the controller
								can
								automatically reduce the brightness of the fixture or turn off the fixture to avoid
								overheating and damage. In addition, sensors can also be used to monitor the power
								status
								and service life of the fixture, reminding users to replace bulbs or repair fixtures in
								a
								timely manner.

								In summary, sensors are an important component of RDM fixtures that provide useful
								environmental and status information to help users better manage and maintain the
								fixture.

						After the "Axes" option, there are three checkboxes. As the name suggests, "Axes" refers to the

						axes are typically those that are rotatable or adjustable. These fixtures often include Moving
						Head Lights, Scanner Lights, and Rotating Ball Lights. By checking the checkboxes, we can
						achieve different axis direction reversals. Checking the first checkbox will reverse the X-axis
						direction, checking the second checkbox will reverse the Y-axis direction, and checking the
						third checkbox will simultaneously reverse both the X and Y axes. This way, you can freely
						adjust the axis direction of the fixtures according to your needs.

				<!-- Personality -->
				<div>
					<p><b>Personality:</b></p>
					<p>
						After the "Personality" option, there is a dropdown menu. This menu displays the current channel

						the menu to reveal a list of other available channel modes from which you can choose.
						By selecting different channel modes, you can change the control method and functionality of the
						fixture. Each channel mode defines a specific set of channel configurations that control various
						attributes and effects of the fixture. For example, a channel mode may include settings for
						color, brightness, movement, and other aspects.
						Using this dropdown menu, you can easily switch between different channel modes for the fixture,
						adapting to different lighting needs and effects.

				<!-- DMX Address -->

						After the "DMX Address" option, there is a numeric input field and two buttons: a forward button

						fixture. You can adjust the value by clicking the forward or backward buttons, or directly
						inputting the desired value in the input field.
						Using this numeric input field and buttons, you can conveniently modify the DMX address of the
						fixture. The DMX address is used to identify the unique position of each fixture within the DMX

				This section showcases all the RDM fixtures that have been discovered. Each row represents an individual
				fixture, with the first column labeled "No." indicating the fixture's serial number. The second column
				labeled "Addr" denotes the DMX address code of the fixture, while the third column labeled "Ch"

				<span class="font-bold">&#x27A4;Visual Enconding Panel :</span><br>
				The Visual Encoding Panel consists of 512 small squares, with 32 squares horizontally and 16 squares
				vertically, totaling 512 squares. Each square represents an address code. In this DMX universe, there
				are 6 fixtures, with each fixture occupying 4 channels. You can see 6 colored squares representing these
				fixtures. The first square of each fixture is blue, indicating the address code of that fixture in this
				DMX universe. When we click on a fixture in the "Fixtures list" on the right side or directly click on
				the fixture displayed as a square, it sends an "identify" command to that fixture. As a result, the
				squares representing the identified fixture on the panel, except for the blue square, will turn purple.
				You can simply drag and drop these small squares to the appropriate positions and click the "Write"
				button to write the new address code into the fixtures.
